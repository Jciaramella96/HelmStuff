Project with blake notes:
1. Database Design & Setup
	• Requirements Gathering: Understand what data needs to be stored, relationships, and expected queries.
	• Schema Design: Normalize tables, define indexes, constraints, and relationships.
	• Technology Choice: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) vs NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB) based on data structure and query patterns.
	• Implementation: Create tables/collections, seed initial data, configure backups.
	• Effort: For a simple schema, a few hours to a day; for complex relational models, several days.

2. API Development
	• Framework Selection: Common choices include Express.js (Node), Flask/FastAPI (Python), Spring Boot (Java).
	• Endpoints Design: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), authentication, pagination, filtering.
	• Data Validation & Error Handling: Ensure clean input and robust responses.
	• Performance Considerations: Caching, indexing, query optimization.
	• Effort: Basic REST API with 4–6 endpoints can take 1–3 days; complex APIs with auth, rate limiting, and analytics can take weeks.

3. Security & Compliance
	• Authentication/Authorization: JWT, OAuth, API keys.
	• Data Protection: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure headers.
	• Effort: Adds 1–2 days for basic security, more for compliance-heavy environments.

4. Deployment & Scaling
	• Hosting: Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-prem.
	• CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment.
	• Monitoring: Logging, metrics, alerting.
	• Effort: Initial setup 1–2 days; ongoing maintenance depends on scale.

Table
Description
areas
area codes (e.g., ZIP, State)
commodities
commodity codes (e.g., UNSPSC, HS)
tax_rates
tax rate records per area × commodity code
tax_jurisdictions
mapping area code → tax zone or jurisdiction
tax_lookup (optional)
hierarchical lookup like CSV example to handle commodity rollups



Lookup flow:
	1. Identify area by code (ZIP or state).
	2. Find exact or hierarchical commodity code match.
	3. Retrieve applicable rate.
