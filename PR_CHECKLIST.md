## 🎯 PR Guidelines

### Title Format
Use one of these suggested formats:
- `feat: enhance config diff tool with recursive scanning and consolidated output`
- `Enhanced Config Diff Tool: Recursive Scanning + Consolidated Output`

### Description Template
Use the template provided in `COMMIT_MESSAGE.md` or create your own following this structure:
1. Summary of changes
2. Key features added
3. Testing performed
4. Breaking changes (none in this case)

### Labels to Add
- `enhancement` - New features added
- `backward-compatible` - No breaking changes
- `tested` - Thoroughly tested changes

## 🔍 Review Focus Areas

Suggest reviewers focus on:
1. **Recursive scanning logic** - Verify it handles edge cases
2. **File path handling** - Ensure paths are normalized correctly
3. **Excel output structure** - Confirm consolidated format is clear
4. **Backward compatibility** - Test with existing directory structures
5. **Error handling** - Check robustness with malformed directories

## 📈 Performance Considerations

Note for reviewers:
- Recursive scanning may be slower on very large directory trees
- Memory usage slightly increased due to OrderedDict and path tracking
- Overall impact is minimal for typical use cases

## 🚀 Post-Merge Notes

After merge, consider:
- [ ] Update any internal documentation
- [ ] Notify users of new nested directory support
- [ ] Consider adding configuration options for recursion depth limits (future enhancement)

## 📝 Additional Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced usability with single-page output
- Better support for complex directory structures
- Maintains original key ordering for intuitive reading
