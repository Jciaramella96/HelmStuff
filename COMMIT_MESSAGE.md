feat: enhance config diff tool with recursive scanning and consolidated output

- Add recursive directory scanning for nested structures (APP/server1/profiles/site.xml)
- Consolidate all differences into single "All Differences" sheet with file name column
- Preserve original key order from configuration files instead of alphabetical sorting
- Implement precise cell highlighting - only cells with actual differences highlighted orange
- Maintain full backward compatibility with existing flat directory structures
- Support file path identifiers for files with same names in different subdirectories

Breaking Changes: None
Tested: âœ… Nested directories, âœ… Flat directories, âœ… Mixed structures, âœ… Precise highlighting
```

```

## PR Description Template

```
## Summary
Enhanced the configuration file diff tool with recursive directory scanning and consolidated Excel output for improved usability.

## Key Features Added
- ðŸ”„ **Recursive Directory Scanning**: Now scans all nested subdirectories 
- ðŸ“Š **Single Consolidated Output**: All differences on one sheet with file name column
- ðŸ“‹ **Preserved Key Order**: Keys appear in original file order (not alphabetical)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Precise Cell Highlighting**: Only cells with actual differences highlighted orange
- âš¡ **Full Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing flat directory structures

## Testing
- âœ… Tested with nested directory structures (`APP/server1/profiles/site.xml`)
- âœ… Verified backward compatibility with existing flat structures  
- âœ… Confirmed key order preservation and file path handling
- âœ… Validated precise cell highlighting logic (majority vs minority values)

## Breaking Changes
None - fully backward compatible
